# Searching for file or directories using `find`

```{r engine='bash', eval=F}
find .
```

`find` shows us files and directories.
The power of find is in specifying "tests" or "filters".

```{r engine='bash', eval=F}
find . -type f
```

```{r engine='bash', eval=F}
find . -type d
```

The above filters search for files and directories, respectively.

**Search depth:**\
One can specify how far down the file hierarchy to go by controlling `depth` (first you should navigate one directory closer to root than the `data-shell` directory):

```{r engine='bash', eval=F, echo=T, error=T}
find ./data-shell -maxdepth 2 -mindepth 2 -type f
```
The above command searches for all files two directory levels within the data-shell folder.  \
**Quick try:** Try other combinations of levels and types and verify by counting number of items in output.

Let's try matching by name:
```{r engine='bash', eval=F, echo=T, error=T}
find ./data-shell -name "*.txt"
```

**Quick try:** Combine `find` and `grep` to find the number of text files within 2 and 3 levels inside of the data-shell folder.

## Exercise 1: Finding Files With Different Properties
The find command can be given several other criteria known as "tests"
to locate files with specific attributes, such as creation time, size,
permissions, or ownership. Use `man find` to explore these, and then
write a single command to find all **.txt** files in or below the current
directory that were modified in the last 168 hours.

Hint 1: you will need to use three tests: `-type`, `-name`, and `-mtime`

Hint 2: The value for `-mtime` will need to be negative - why?

# Setting and viewing variables
variables are strings that can be assigned values.  To create a variable use the following format:
```{r engine='bash', eval=T, echo=T}
var=variable # when setting variable do not use spaces
```
To see what the variable is you can print it to the screen with **echo**:
```{r engine='bash', eval=T, echo=T}
echo $var  # the '$' designates that this is a variable
```
*Try using echo without the dollar sign.\

Whole sentences or lists can be designated as variables:
```{r engine='bash', eval=T, echo=T}
fileList=*.txt
echo $fileList
```

If your variable is going to be combined with another string, make sure you surround the variable with a curly bracket.  For instance:
```{r engine='bash', eval=T, echo=T}
School=MEDS
echo listing: $School
echo this class is $School_5420 # something's wrong
echo this class is ${School}_5420  # properly inserts variable

```

## Setting variables using single vs. double quotes vs. back ticks
In short, double quotes allows variables within strings to be interpreted, whereas single quotes makes them literal.\
Try out this example:
```{r engine='bash', eval=T, echo=TRUE}
instructor="Michael Guertin"
echo "My instructor for MEDS5420 is $instructor"
```
or
 
```{r engine='bash', eval=T, echo=TRUE}
instructor="Michael Guertin"
echo 'My instructor for MEDS5420 is $instructor'
```

## Executing commands 'in place' within variables
**Uses for backticks** - the key usually just under the escape key.\
Backticks allow one to insert the result of a command in place within a command line.\
One nice use for this is to set variables as outputs of commands.\
Here's an example with the command `date` that prints the date and time to the screen:\
Compare the two following examples:
```{r engine='bash', eval=T, echo=TRUE}
info=date
echo The date and time is: $info
```
vs.
```{r engine='bash', eval=T, echo=TRUE}
info=`date`
echo The date and time is: $info
```

Backticks can cause problems when using other quotations, so there is another way to run a command in place:

```{r engine='bash', eval=T, echo=TRUE}
echo The date and time is: $(date)
```


# Scripting in the shell.
Scripts are a logially ordered set of commands used to process files.  They can be simple routines or complex programs.  There are three main things one needs when writing scripts in general: \
**1.** The commands themselves \

**2.** Information about what language should be used to interpret the commands \

**3.** Permission to execute commands in script file. \



### Text editors: 
Certain text editors are designed for scripting and can recognize code.  Importantly, they do not embed the document or fonts with hidden characteristics that can cause problems when running programs on you computer.  There are three features that you should look for in an editor:\

**1.** language specific highlighting \

**2.** line number display \

**3.** version control \

**MAC USERS:** Download BBedit here: [http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/download.html?ref=tw_alert](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/download.html?ref=tw_alert): http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/download.html?ref=tw_alert and then install it:

Open your text editor: **gedit** on Linux or **BBEdit** or **textEdit** on Mac.

**PC USERS:**
download notepad here: [https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.5.8.html](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.5.8.html)


**Note:** You can also use **emacs** or other command line editors such as `nano` or `vim`. These command line editors are the functional equivalent of opening a file in BBEdit, TextEdit, or NotePad. THe interface is a bit clunky and requires keyboard prompts to save, write, and exit. We will be using `emacs` or `nano` when we work on the server next time.\

```{r  out.width = "120%", echo=F, fig.align = "center", fig.cap="XKCD: Real programmers"}
#library(knitr)
knitr::include_graphics("./fig/real_programmers.png") 
```


A quick primer for `emacs` is:

```{r engine='bash', eval=F, echo=TRUE}
#generate the file
touch filename.sh

# open the emacs command line editor
emacs filename.sh

#you are now in EMACS
write some code

ctrl-X ctrl-W to save as another name

make edits

ctrl-X ctrl-S to save

ctrl-X ctrl-C to exit

#you are back in the Terminal
```

A quick primer for `nano` is:

```{r engine='bash', eval=F, echo=TRUE}
touch filename_nano.sh

nano filename_nano.sh

#you are now in NANO
write some code

ctrl-O, then <Enter/Return> to save

ctrl-O, then backspace to write as a new file name, then <Enter/Return> to save 

make edits

ctrl-O, then <Enter/Return> to save

ctrl-X  to exit

```


The first line is the [Shebang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_%28Unix%29) line:
```{r engine='bash', eval=F, echo=TRUE}
#! /bin/sh

or sometimes

#! /usr/bin/sh
```

to find out where your shell is type:
```{r engine='bash', eval=F, echo=TRUE}
which sh
```

Let's try a simple script:
```{r engine='bash', eval=F, echo=TRUE}
ls -la
echo "Above are the directory listings for the following folder"
pwd
```

Create a new folder in your MEDS5420 folder called *'scripts'*
\
Save your script as `ls.sh`
\
Go to the directory where ls.sh is and try to execute it:
```{r engine='bash', eval=F, echo=TRUE}
./ls.sh
```
In order to run this script we need to give the proper permissions.  To see permissions for files, type:
```{r engine='bash', eval=F, echo=TRUE}
ls -la
```
The columns are:

**1.** permissions \
**2.** owner \
**3.** group \
**4.** size \
**5.** last modifiation \
**6.** name \ 
 

In permissions: 'd'=directory, '-' = file, 'r' = read, 'w' = write, 'x' = execute.
\
Three sets of permissions are shown: User (owner), Group, Other users.

To give permission to execute type:
```{r engine='bash', eval=F, echo=TRUE}
chmod +x ls.sh
```
Now use `ls -la` to view permissions and then try to execute.

Other ways to designate permissions:

```{r  out.width = "100%", echo=F, fig.align = "center", fig.cap="Permissions"}
#library(knitr)
knitr::include_graphics("./fig/Numerical_permissions_MJG.png") 
```



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To give permission for everone to read, write, and execute a script use:
```{r engine='bash', eval=F, echo=TRUE}
chmod 777 ls.sh
```

### Scripting with a loop
```{r engine='bash', eval=T, echo=TRUE}
list="1 2 4 6"
for x in $list
do
   echo Hello people of MEDS_5420
done
```
The numbers mean nothing here.  They are just placeholders such that every time an item is encountered the loop repeats itself.  For instance:

```{r engine='bash', eval=T, echo=TRUE}
list="a b c"
for x in $list
do
   echo Hello people of MEDS_5420
done
```


## Exercise 2: 
Create a shell script, called `grad_folders.sh` that does the following:\
**1.** Create a variable that lists the following items: notebook, raw_data, figures, manuscripts.\
**2.** Create a folder for each item that is named the same as each item.\
**3.** Print to the screen what is happening (i.e. that you are creating a folder).\
**4.** Copy the haiku.txt file into each folder.

# What we've learned so far:

**1.** How to navigate your computer from your terminal and create or find files and folders (`cd, ls, mv, rm, mkdir, touch, find`) \
**2.** How to view the content of files (head, tail, less), and search for specific lines or items (grep) \
**3.** How to combine multiple files together (cat) and redirect terminal output into new or existing files (> or > > ). \
**4.** How to string several commands together with pipes ('|') \
**5.** The importance of quoting syntax. \
**6.** The beginnings of shell scripting. \


# More commands 

**1.** Learn a few more useful terminal commands: **sort, cut, uniq** \

# Creating path and filename shortcuts with variables

Download `color-table.txt` from the Lecture 4 folder in GitHub and move this file to your MEDS5420 folder.  \

It is not immediately apparent how to download the file from GitHub, but you do have access to the **Raw** file by clicking **Raw**. We can use a command in the Terminal to directly retrive this raw file without having to click **Save As** in the browser. \

If you have a Mac, then `curl` is the default method to retrieve files from URLs:

```{r engine='bash', eval=F, echo=T}
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guertinlab/meds5420/main/Lecture4_command_line/color-table.txt
#the manual will tell you what the -O (the letter, not a zero) option does 
```

Linux OS have `wget`:

```{r engine='bash', eval=F, echo=T}
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guertinlab/meds5420/main/Lecture4_command_line/color-table.txt
```

Let's tuck the color-table.txt file away into some new directories:

```{r engine='bash', eval=F, echo=T}
#start from the MEDS5420 folder:
mkdir ./in_class
mkdir ./in_class/colors
mv color-table.txt ./in_class/colors
```


```{r engine='bash', eval=T, echo=T}
table="./in_class/colors/color-table.txt"
head $table
```


# String splitting and manipulation

The **cut** command is useful for splitting strings based on user-defined delimiters.  For instance, if I want to extract only the time from the **date** command you can try this:

```{r engine='bash', eval=T, echo=TRUE}
# selects the 4th item after the line is split by spaces (" ")
echo "the date and time is:"
echo $(date)

echo "the time is:"
echo $(date) | cut -d " " -f 4  

```

`-d`: is the delimiter set by user.  Default is tab: `\t`\
`-f`: the fields to select for after splitting.  Can list each (1,2,3) or list a range (1-3)\
\

reversing a string:
```{r engine='bash', eval=T, echo=TRUE}
# returns backwards string

echo `date` | rev

```

Can be done on any part of a pipe

```{r engine='bash', eval=T, echo=TRUE}
echo $(date)

echo "the reverse time is:"
echo $(date) | cut -d " " -f 4 |rev

```


**Extracting columns from tables:** Cut can also be used to extract columns from tables.\


Let's just get the first column of `color-table.txt`:
```{r engine='bash', eval=T, echo=T}
table="./in_class/colors/color-table.txt"
cat $table | cut -f 1
```

**Sorting columns:** Simple sorting of columns

```{r engine='bash', eval=T, echo=T}
sort -k 2 color-table.txt | head -n 5

# k followed by a number represents the column to sort by.
```

Notice how numbers are handled.  They are handled as a string of numbers and each position in evaluated seperately.  If you want a true numeric sort, try this:
```{r engine='bash', eval=T, echo=T}
#numerical sort on column 2

sort -k 2n color-table.txt | head -n 5
```
The option `-k 2` sorts on column 2, but if column 2 is identical, the row will continue to be sorted until a distinct character can differentiate. The following will only sort on column 2 and retain the original relative order of row that have identical column 2 values. 

```{r engine='bash', eval=T, echo=T}
#numerical sort on column 2

sort -k 2,2n color-table.txt | head -n 5
```


Numerical sorts are ascending, to return a descending sort, try the following:

```{r engine='bash', eval=T, echo=T}
#numerical sort on column 2

sort -k 2nr color-table.txt | head -n 5

```

Finding unique items in list.  You can use `uniq` to determine how many times an item appears in a list.  

```{r engine='bash', eval=T, echo=T}
# -c prints the number of each item
cat color-table.txt | cut -f 3 | uniq -c | head 
```
One pitfall is that it only operates on adjacent items, so lists must be sorted first:
```{r engine='bash', eval=T, echo=T}
# sorting first gives true number of unique items

cat color-table.txt | cut -f 3 |sort | uniq -c | head  

```

## In class exercise 3: Extract the last item from a string of unknown length.
Consider this filename at the end of the path: /tempdata3/MEDS5420/data/raw/chip_repA.txt\
\
Devise a way to split the string and report the filename without referencing the exact position. i.e. imagine that you want to get the last item in the path without knowing how long the path is.
