# Mask and Social Distancing Expectations
Until further notice, to ensure a safe learning environment for everyone, Dr. Guertin requests that approved masks/face coverings must be worn at all times in the classroom, regardless of vaccination status. No eating is permitted in the classroom; brief unmasking to drink is permitted. For any other activities that require unmasking, please leave the classroom. If an instructor is not wearing a mask/face covering, students should feel comfortable asking the instructor to put one on immediately.  More information about proper usage of masks is available from the following link: https://health.uconn.edu/coronavirus/mask-protocol/
Although social distancing will not be required inside classrooms for vaccinated individuals, please be respectful of the wishes of others who prefer to maintain social distancing. For their own protection, unvaccinated individuals are requested to maintain 6 feet social distancing from others.

Course Number: MEDS 5420

Credits:  4

Time: 1-3 pm, Monday and Thursday

Room: R1401 Cell and Genome Sciences Building 400 Farmington Ave.

[redacted]
   
Prerequisites:  none

Professor/Instructor/Facilitator:  Michael Guertin 

Pronouns: he/him/his

Email: [redacted]

Student Hours: Students are encouraged to reach out by email to schedule one-on-one video meetings or in-person traditional office hours.


# Course Materials

Required course materials should be obtained before the first day of class.

Students must have a personal computer that is capable of running a Unix or Linux operating system.  

Course readings and media are available within HuskyCT, through either a link or Library Resources 

# Course Description

Coupling classical molecular biology techniques to high throughput sequencing for nucleic acid detection has revolutionized how scientists study biology. MEDS 5420 will introduce students to the command line and gradually build upon concepts and skills so that students will be capable of building workflows to process and analyze high throughput sequencing data. After basic concepts and command line competency are established, the course will focus on the analysis of ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data. Students will learn to use many common genomics software packages to perform such tasks as genome alignment, peak calling, motif analysis, and differential expression analysis. If time permits, students will be introduced to the statistical computing language R and perform analyses and visualization using an R interface.    

# Instructor Thoughts

The study of biology has been completely transformed with the data revolution. Analysis is often rate-limiting scientific progress, not data acquisition. Classically trained molecular biologists, biochemists, and cell biologists are often the best equipped to articulate and ask the most relevant questions regarding a dataset, but they may lack the expertise to carry out the appropriate analyses. The mere thought of analyzing such massive datasets can be intimidating. The main goal of this class is to prepare students so that they are comfortable navigating and analyzing massive datasets and to effectively remove any intimidation barrier.  

# Course Objectives

By the end of the semester, you should be able to: 

Comfortably navigate the command line.

Use shell scripting to automate parsing, processing, and analysis of genomics data.

Design ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses, with an emphasis on control experiments/conditions.

Align sequencing reads to reference genomes.

Retrieve publicly available genomic data sets.

Visualize genomics data on a browser.

Perform alignment, peak calling, and motif analysis starting of raw ChIP-seq data.

Perform alignment, differential expression, and gene set enrichment analysis of raw RNA-seq data. 

# Course Format

Each class will begin with a short lecture. The instructor will walk through analyses in real-time and the students will spend the majority of class time walking through exercises in parallel with the instructor and learning the skills that are necessary to analyze genomics data.
At the end of each class students may be at different places depending on the speed of their progress during class. Students are expected to finish any of the in-class exercises at home prior to the next class so that everyone will be at the same point at the beginning of the next class. Please come with questions about the previous exercises, but do not expect to use in class time to catch up.

Xanadu server access

Students will have access to a class allocation on the Xanadu server for this course. The instructor will distribute usernames and passwords during the third week of classes. I recommend using this course-associated account even if you have your own already. This will avoid confusion with directory tree structure and problems with access when the server gets busy. You will need to transfer your data to your own account before the end of the semester. To request a personal account fill out the form here: https://bioinformatics.uconn.edu/contact-us/

Course Requirements and Grading

# Summary of Course Grading:

Course Components

In class exercises 20%

Homework 30%

Midterm project 25%

Final project 25%


# In class exercises
Students will be presented with short tasks throughout the lecture and we will go over the exercises as a class. Questions are encouraged and participation is necessary. 
# Homework
Two to four homework assignments will be assigned throughout the semester. Verbal collaboration, searching code online, and chatGPT are acceptable if attribution is noted. 
# Midterm
The midterm project is analysis of ChIP-seq data. Each student is provided with ChIP-seq data from an unknown sequence-specific transcription factor. Students will analyze the data and provide their analysis code and conclusions regarding the identity of the factor. 
# Final 	
The final project is analysis of RNA-seq data. Each student is provided with RNA-seq data from unknown treatments. Students will analyze the data and provide their analysis code and conclusions regarding the treatment condition.

# Due Dates and Late Policy

All course due dates are identified on GitHub. Deadlines are based on Eastern Time unless otherwise specified. The instructor reserves the right to change dates accordingly as the semester progresses. All changes will be communicated in an appropriate manner. Reasonable accommodations will be made for late homework and projects if the instructor is informed prior to the due date or extenuating circumstances prevent prior notification.

# Feedback and Grades

I will make every effort to provide feedback and grades within a week of the due dates. To keep track of your performance in the course, refer to My Grades in HuskyCT.

# Weekly Time Commitment

You should expect to dedicate 10-15 hours a week to this course--this 10-15 hours includes the 4 hours of class time. This expectation is based on the various course activities, assignments, and assessments and the University of Connecticut’s policy regarding credit hours. (More information related to hours per week per credit can be accessed at the Online Student website).
