# Last Time:

## Command line navigation:
\
1. Complete path:
```{r engine='bash', eval=F, echo=TRUE}
head /home/username/MEDS5420/lec02_files/the_raven.txt
head /Users/username/MEDS5420/lec02_files/the_raven.txt

```
```{r engine='bash', eval=F, echo=TRUE}
head ~/MEDS5420/lec02_files/the_raven.txt
```
**OR** \
\
2. By using the **relative path** starting from where you are:\

```{r engine='bash', eval=F, echo=TRUE}
head ./username/MEDS5420/lec02_files/the_raven.txt
```
```{r engine='bash', eval=F, echo=TRUE}
head username/MEDS5420/lec02_files/the_raven.txt
```
## Command line utlities so far:

**1.** `pwd` - print working directory\
**2.** `ls` - list directory contents\
**3.** `mkdir` - create a directory\
**4.** `unzip` - decompression\
**5.** `mv` - move file\
**6.** `cp` - copy file\
**7.** `cat` - print contents of file\
**8.** `touch` - create empty file\
**9.** `rm` - remove file\
**10.** `wc` - count lines/words/characters/ in file\
**11.** `>` - redirects output to new file\
**12.** `>>` - redirects output to append to existing file\
**13.** `*` - wildcard that specifies any input\


# Pipes, filtering with wildcards, redirecting outputs to files

One can select multiple files using the `*` wildcard. Navigate to the `~/MEDS5420/lec02_files` directory and type:

```{r engine='bash', eval=F, echo=T}
wc *.txt
```

Instead of seeing the 3 columns of numbers for the number of lines,
words and characters, we can limit the `wc` command to only show us
the number of lines using the `-l` argument:

```{r engine='bash', eval=F, echo=T}
wc -l *.txt
```

One can also add some specificity to wild cards using  brackets: `[]`
```{r engine='bash', eval=F, echo=T}
wc -l [Wt]*.txt
    # this is equivalent to saying files that start with a "W" or "t"
```

Let's find which file is shortest.  Let's save the `wc` output to disk
with the redirection `>` operator; then we can verify the contents of
`length.txt` are the same as what `wc` produces using `cat` or `less`:

```{r engine='bash', eval=F, echo=T}
wc -l *.txt > lengths.txt
cat lengths.txt
less lengths.txt
```

To find the shortest file, we then sort the lengths using the `sort`
command.  We then pick the top shortest file using `head -n 1`:

```{r engine='bash', eval=F, echo=T}
sort -n lengths.txt > sorted-lengths.txt
head -n 1 sorted-lengths.txt
```

Using the intermediate files can be confusing, especially in more
complex problems.  We can save a lot of messy files and typing using
pipes (`|`):

```{r engine='bash', eval=F, echo=T}
wc -l *.txt | sort -n | head -n 1
```

## Exercise 1: Pipe Reading Comprehension

A file called animals.txt contains the following data:

```
deer
rabbit
raccoon
rabbit
deer
fox
rabbit
bear
```

### Part 1:  
What text passes through each of the pipes and the final redirect in the pipeline below? Manually rearrange and parse the input before you run or deconstruct the command.

```{r engine='bash', eval=F, echo=T}
cat animals.txt | head -n 5 | tail -n 3 | sort > final.txt
```

### Part 2:
Alter the commands to get only all three rabbits as the final output.


# Additional Commands:
## File Compression

Command | Function
--------|---------
`gzip`  | compression/decompression tool using Lempel-Ziv coding (LZ77)
`tar`  | Bundling files in folders

## Finding things:
- Files in directories
- words in files


|  Command    | Function                                                      |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `grep`      | **G**lobal **R**egular **E**xpression **P**rint (useful flags: `-w`, `-i`, `-v`, `-n`)                        |
| `find`      | Recursively list all files and directories and filter         |


## Concepts:

**1.** Variables (creating and printing to screen).\
**2.** Basics of shell scripts.\




# Dealing with compressed files (archives)

Download and move the *data-shell.tar* from GitHub to your MEDS5420 folder. See the third code chunk of section 6 of Lecture 2 for how to accomplish this for Windows OS. \

We already unzipped a file using **unzip**:
```{r engine='bash', eval=F, echo=TRUE}
unzip -d Example_files Example_files.zip
```
Other types of archives you will encounter:\
**.tar** # bundles multiple files or folders\
**.gzip** # compressed file\
\pagebreak 

```{r  out.width = "120%", echo=F, fig.align = "center", fig.cap="XKCD: valid `tar` command"}
#library(knitr)
knitr::include_graphics("./fig/tar.png") 
```


To view contents of archive:
```{r engine='bash', eval=F, echo=TRUE}
tar -tvf data-shell.tar # displays tar contents
```

To extract contents of archive:
```{r engine='bash', eval=F, echo=TRUE}
tar -xvf data-shell.tar # extracts contents into original directories
```


To combine contents of a directory:
```{r engine='bash', eval=F, echo=TRUE}
tar -cvf data-shell_retar.tar data-shell 

#format is <target.tar> <directory-to-be-tarred>
#For directories, execute command in parent directory (one level up). 
#Don't use absolute path. 
```


Compressing files with gzip:
```{r engine='bash', eval=F, echo=TRUE}
gzip filename #  compresses file
```

Let's look a specific example in the writing folder within data.shell

```{r engine='bash', eval=F, echo=TRUE}
cd ./data-shell/writing/leisure/

ls
```

To view contents of a gzipped file (linux):
```{r engine='bash', eval=F, echo=TRUE}
zcat haiku.txt.gz | head
```

On a Mac use this instead:
```{r engine='bash', eval=F, echo=TRUE}
gunzip -c haiku.txt.gz | head
```
**OR**
\
`gzcat` on a Mac

```{r engine='bash', eval=F, echo=TRUE}
gzcat haiku.txt.gz | head
```

**Note:** These commands are useful because they allow you to glance at or access the contents of large compressed files without spending the time of decompressing them.


To extract gzipped files:
```{r engine='bash', eval=F, echo=TRUE}
gunzip haiku.txt.gz #decompresses file
```


# Finding things

## Searching inside files using `grep`

We can search for patterns inside of files and print them using the `grep` command.
Let's head over to the writing directory and try using `grep`:
\
Have a look at `haiku.txt`:

```{r engine='bash', eval=T}
cat haiku.txt
```

When was `haiku.txt` last modified? 
```{r engine='bash', eval=T}
ls -l haiku.txt
```

```{r engine='bash', echo=T, eval=T}
grep bug haiku.txt
```




In the above command, the first argument "bug" is the pattern we are searching for.  The default action for `grep` is to return the entire line in which the pattern was found.


Let's instead search for the word day:

```{r engine='bash'}
grep day haiku.txt
```


In this case that `grep` shows us results with larger words containing "day".
We might instead only want to see exact words not part of larger words.
To impose word boundaries, we use the `-w` flag:

```{r engine='bash', error=T}
grep -w day haiku.txt
```


There are no results because "day" is only part of larger words in `haiku.txt`

Sometimes we want to search for more than a single word.
To search for a phrase, we need to use double quotes so that `grep` treats the pattern as a single argument.

```{r engine='bash'}
grep -w "is not" haiku.txt
```


Other very useful `grep` flags are `-n`, `-i` and `-v`:

```{r engine='bash'}
grep -n "it" haiku.txt
```


```{r engine='bash'}
grep -n -w -i "the" haiku.txt
```

As you might have guessed:

- `-n` prints the line number of the matching line.
- `-i` ignores capitalization (also called "case"; the "i" comes from case-**i**nsensitive)

You can learn more about `grep` flags using `grep --help`

The real power of `grep` is using a special class of wildcards known as "regular expressions" (the "re" in `grep`).
Let's use regular expressions to find lines where the second letter is "o":

```{r engine='bash'}
grep '^.o' haiku.txt
```

Explanation of the pattern:

- The caret (`^`) tells `grep` to only look from the start of a line rather than anywhere in the line.
- The dot (`.`) tells `grep` to match any single character (letter, number, or symbol) - basically a single character **wild card**.
- The "o" means to specifically only match the letter "o" (it will not match an upper case "O").

Some other useful expression in grep:

- `$` specifies the matching at end of a line. \
- `*` in grep, the asterisk is a repetition operator. This is commonly coupled to `.` to act as a wild card of unspecified length 


Learning the full power of regular expressions takes time,
but for now just know that they exist.  If you want to make use of them, check out these **cheat sheets** and other online resources.

- [https://cheatography.com/davechild/cheat-sheets/regular-expressions/](https://cheatography.com/davechild/cheat-sheets/regular-expressions/)

## Exercise 2: 'regex' with grep

1) Use the criteria below to print the appropriate lines from `haiku.txt`:

- lines that begin with the letter s
- lines that end in the letter d
- lines that begin and end with the letters s and d 
- lines with words that begin with the letter n


## Exercise 3: Command practice and 'grepping' patterns
Look in the `song_lyrics` folder inside the data-shell folder and you should see a single file: `TS_example.txt`
The TS_example.txt file contains lyrics to a song by a well-known contemporary female artist. Using the command line utilities you have learned, try the following:

**1.** Print the number of lines in the file. \

**2.** Print the lines **and line number** that have the word 'shake' in them to a new file called `shake-lines.txt`. \
**3.** Print the number of lines that have the word 'shake' in them. \
**4.** Devise a way to print the **number of times** 'shake' appears in the song.  Be sure to include all instances or forms of the word. \

**\*hint:** use the manuals for different functions to see what your options could be.

# Answers to in class exercises


## Answers to Exercise 1

Part1:\
`cat` prints all the contents of `animals.txt` and passes it on to
`head`.  Standard output from `cat` (or standard input to `head`):

```
deer
rabbit
raccoon
rabbit
deer
fox
rabbit
bear
```

`head` reads the first 5 lines of that output and passes it on to
`tail`.  Standard output from `head` (or standard input to `tail`):


```
deer
rabbit
raccoon
rabbit
deer
```

`tail` reads the last 3 lines of the output and passes it on to
`sort`.  Standard output from `tail` (or standard input to `sort`):

```
raccoon
rabbit
deer
```

`sort` rearranges the lines in alphabetical order (you can
read the `man` pages of `sort` to discern the arguments, including  `-r` which is reverse alphabetical) and saves them into `final.txt`.  Standard output from `sort` (or contents of `final.txt`)

```
deer
rabbit
raccoon
```
Part 2: \
```{r engine='bash', eval=F, echo=T}
cat animals.txt | sort | tail -4 | head -3
```


## Exercise 2: Grep with 'regex'
1) Use the criteria below to print the appropriate lines from `haiku.txt`:

- lines that begin with the letter s:\
  `grep -i '^s' haiku.txt`
- lines that end in the letter d:\
  `grep -i 'd$' haiku.txt`
- lines that begin and end with the letters s and d:\
  `grep -i '^s.*d$' haiku.txt`
- lines with words that begin with the letter n. This requires a Google search, to specify the first and last letters of words use `\<` (start of word) and `\>` (end of word). \
  `grep -i '\<n' haiku.txt` or `grep -w -i "n.*"`


## Exercise 3: 'grepping' patterns
 
The TS\_example.txt file contains lyrics to a song by a well-known contemporary female artist. Using the command line utilities you just learned, try the following: \
**1.** Print the number of lines in the file: `wc -l TS_example.txt` \
**2.** Print the lines **and line number** that have the word 'shake' in them to a new file called `shake-lines.txt`: `grep -n -i shake  TS_example.txt > shake-lines.txt` -this answer will print all instances of *shake* regardless of upper and lowercase letters due to the `-i` option.\
**3.** Print the number of lines that have the word 'shake' in them: `grep -c shake TS_example.txt` -this answer is not sensitive to upper and lowercase \
**4.** Devise a way to print the **number of times** 'shake' appears in the song: `grep -o -i shake TS_example.txt | wc -w` \
-here the `-o` will only print the *shake* part of the line to a new line in the output and we can pipe to `wc` and count the number of words \

**\*Hint:** use the manuals for different functions to see what your options could be.
